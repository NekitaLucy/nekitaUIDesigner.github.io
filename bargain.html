              <h2>Purpose</h2>
              <p>
                The objective is to design a responsive web application for
                location-based recommendations that meets the requirements of
                its users and solves the problems they encounter with existing
                applications.
              </p>
              <h2>Problem statement</h2>
              <p>
                Research and design a responsive web app for a sales locator
                through a user-centric design process. Many apps need more
                personalization, making users receive irrelevant recommendations
                that align with their preferences and interests.
              </p>
              <h2>Solution</h2>
              <p>
                I used user research, interviews, user flows, A/B testing,
                real-time updates to the store, and a mobile and desktop
                experience to address the problems that users are experiencing.

                  Search for sales near the user's location. A location finder
                  web app can help users save money by going to stores near them
                  and saving money on items they regularly buy or are interested
                  in buying when promotions are available.

                  Preliminary ideas will be a filter feature for users to choose
                  the types of sales/promotions they want to see on the map. For
                  example, grocery stores and their items on sale, clothes,
                  food, electronics, museums or services. Dates on how long the

                <h3>UX Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                  Layout: The layout of the web app is seamless to navigate. The
                  user can easily zoom in on the digital flyers once they tap on
                  it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Navigation structure: the menu bar has recognizable icons, and
                  the categories of retailers are listed below the menu options,
                  making it easy to change what type of shopping experience the
                  user wants.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Compatibility: The web app is compatible with several
                  browsers, especially Safari. If the user has an iPhone, it's
                  more seamless as an app on the Safari browser. It's compatible
                  with Chrome and Microsoft.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Call to action: they have a signup page for brands and
                  retailers to work with them in digital marketing on the
                  platform and the primary account for consumers to sign up and
                  customize their shopping experience. The app can only activate
                  the shopping list, cards, and notifications.
                </p>
                <h2>Competitor web app 2: Reebee</h2>
                <h3>UX Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                  Usability: the web app allows users to access the additional
                  features and will enable users to sign in and create shopping
                  lists.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Layout: the layout is simple to navigate. The menu dashboard
                  has enough space for the shopping categories that users can
                  choose from and slide to see more categories.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Differentiation: The feature they highlight in the menu is for
                  users to create a shopping list, and the items are featured in
                  their window when the user taps on an item, so the user
                  doesn't have to zoom in on the flyer.
